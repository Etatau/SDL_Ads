# SDL_Ads (W.I.P)
This is an unofficial library.

## How it works
I used JNI to make glue code.

## Note
This is a **Proof of Concept** as of this stage and I plan to release a pre-alpha build with most of the Ad types added to it.\
This is will only be available for android until I feel like adding support for IOS.

## Current goal

A build release containing basic functionality (support for all ad types).
